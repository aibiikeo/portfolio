        Hello, My name is Aibiike.
        I am a 2nd year student of AIU.
        And I come from Toktogul.
        I went to school in Toktogul for six years, then in Jalal-Abad for five years, and now I'm studying computer science at Ala-Too International University.
        I used to love reading books and listening to music a lot, but now I don't have as much time for reading.
        However, I still enjoy listening to music.
        In the future, I want to use my computer skills to be creative and make new things.
